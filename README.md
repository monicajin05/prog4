# prog4 shell

In this project, I rendered input triangles and ellipses with texture, lighting, and transparency. To add onto this project, I also entended its functionality by allowing it to process moving, looping videos (mp4) as textures as well by updating the texture every frame. 

I claim the extra credit (0.5%): support transparent textures.
- I made use of the alpha component in textures during rendering.
